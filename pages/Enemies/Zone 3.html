<p>
	First, skeleton riders. These guys move every beat and are really dangerous - black skeleton riders do a whopping 3 full hearts of damage. Hitting them will
	result in them getting knocked of the horse and turning into their respective shielded skeleton. Remember those guys? In order to take care of them, we need
	to learn about getting on parity.
</p>
<p>
	Parity is judging how far away an enemy is from you. If they are 1 tile away from you, trying to move into them will hurt you. On the other hand, you can
	safely attack every beat enemies if you are right next to them. If you are on odd parity, you can let them move right next to you by dropping a beat,
	digging a wall, or using items.
</p>
	When you attack the rider, you will cause it to get knocked back, turning it into a shielded skeleton in its place. They move on the very next beat, so if
	you try to move towards it immediately, you'll get hurt. Instead, after hitting it, you can move to the side, then over to the side of the skeleton. Then
	you can just attack it for free because you aren't facing the shield.
</p>
<p>
	Black skeleton riders require a bit more dancing around. Hitting skeletons from the side will kill white ones and make yellow ones headless, but black
	skeletons will just attack you back. Instead of attacking right away, move to the side again and then you're free to attack them twice in a row, rendering
	them mostly harmless.
</p>
<p>
	However, there's an easier way. If you are near a wall, you can move <span class="i">away</span> from the wall, and then hit the rider chasing you. Because
	the rider was just following you from the other direction, you will now be facing the skeleton's side. Then you can just deal with them as normal.
</p>

<p>Just be careful with black skeleton riders, because remember, they move right away. You'll need to step to the side in order to attack them safely.</p>
<h2>Goblins</h2>

<p><span class="i">Did you know gray goblins do three hearts of damage?</span></p>
<p>
	Ah, yes, goblins, one of the most annoying enemies. When you chase them, they will run away from you. But if you run away from them, they will start chasing
	you. This makes it hard to get close enough to them to kill them. And once you do get close enough to them, if you jump next to them, they will attack you,
	regardless of if you were chasing them or not.
</p>
<p>There are several ways to take them out.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		First, you can chase them until they are pushed against the wall. You can then get closer until you are just one or two tiles away.
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you get a single tile away, you can then run away, making them chase you. Be careful not to go back towards them, otherwise you'll take
				damage. You can then buffer a beat by digging a wall or just staying still.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you start running away once you are two tiles away from the goblin, you can prep your dagger throw, and then throw at a nearby wall. Because
				this takes two beats, the goblin will now be next to you. Simply pick up your dagger and then take them out. This strategy is especially helpful for characters like Aria and Coda.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You can also run away from them and wait for them to come to you. Dig walls or just stand still until they are next to you, then kill them.</li>
	<li>If you have a throwable weapon, ths is one of the best ways to utilize that. Line them up and then just throw to kill.</li>
	<li>
		Of course, if you have a weapon that hits more than a single tile in front of you, like a broadsword or a spear, goblins become much easier to deal
		with. No explanation is really needed.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shovemonsters</h2>
<img class="float-left" width="108px" src="./images/enemies/zone 3/shovemonster.png" />
<img class="float-left" width="108px" src="./images/enemies/zone 3/shovemonster_gray.png" />
<p>Shovemonsters are relatively simple. They move every beat, and instead of doing regular damage, they push you. This means parity doesn't matter, and you can just run towards them without any worries. If you are squished against something, you'll take 0.5 hearts of damage. Their real threat is in moving you into further danger; by themselves, they aren't too bad.</p>
<p>You can take advantage of the fact that they push you by digging walls or attacking on hot coals. They will immediately move you through the wall if you're aligned properly, and you won't take damage from hot coals. You can also do silly things like this:</p>

<h2>Elementals</h2>

<img class="float-left" height="108px" src="./images/enemies/zone 3/ice_elemental1.png" />
<p>These guys are pretty annoying if you don't deal with them quickly. Every three beats, they move one tile, trailing either hot coals or ice. Something interesting to note is that they move every odd number of beats, rather than every even number of beats like most enemies. Because of this, you will always be on the same "parity" with them, even if they move slowly. You can also always kill them in one movement cycle. If they just barely moved, moving towards them and attacking them will always kill them before they can attack you, if you are close.</p>
<p>Something cool is that they can also convert ice tiles into hot coal tiles and vice versa. Every beat, ice turns into water, which turns into a normal tile on the next beat, and then finally turns into hot coals. On the other hand, hot coals turn into a regular tile right away, and then turn into ice.</p>
<h2>Beetles</h2>

<img class="float-left" height="108px" src="./images/enemies/zone 3/beetle2.png" />
<p>The beetles' main gimmick are the shells they protect themselves with. You can't do regular damage to them while they are covered; they drop tiles all around them when hit while still shelled. Strangely, this means that having a bigger weapon makes these guys <i>excruciatingly painful</i> to deal with. Because the only way they lose their shell is by you being adjacent to them, you need to hop around them until you can align correctly, or just stand still and wait for them to come to you. If you only have a dagger, these guys are no more difficult than any other two-beat enemy; just keep in mind they drop a tile when they lose their shell.</p>

<p>Yes, these guys are painful when they drop tiles everywhere. On the other hand, it also means you can get hilarious videos like this one:</p>
