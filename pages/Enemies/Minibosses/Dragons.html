<p>There are several types of dragons.</p>
<h2>Green Dragons</h2>

	Green dragons are really easy. You can basically treat them as skeletons with more health. Hit them, move back, and repeat until they die. The downgrade in
	difficulty from other dragons to green dragons is one of the main reasons why the Ring of Peace is such a good ring. However, they
	<span class="i">do</span> deal three hearts of damage, enough to one-shot most characters, which means you have to be really careful.

<p>
	With an extremely long horizontal attack that is difficult to dodge in tight corridors, these guys are an issue for both new and skilled players. However,
	there are simple ways to deal with them. For instance, their fireball attack can only attack horizontally, which means if you deal with them from above or
	below, you can treat them like green dragons but with more health. If you run out of room, just hop to the side, scoot around them, and go behind them. You
	can then continue as normal.
