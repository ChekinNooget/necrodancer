	Welcome to my strategy guide! I created this with the intention of making an easily accessible guide for people of all skill levels; I've found it's hard to
	learn advanced strategies about this game without having to directly ask people. Even if you're just starting to learn Cadence, or if you're playing
	characters like Coda, there are tips and tricks here for everyone to read.
</p>
<p>
	Suggestions and additions are always welcome - you can either make a pull request or issue on the
	<a href="https://github.com/ChekinNooget/necrodancer">github page</a>, or email me at chekinnooget@gmail.com. Even small grammar fixes will be appreciated!
</p>
<p>If a page is empty, don't worry, it's not a bug (I hope), it just means I haven't gotten around to making a page yet. I'll do it someday...</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the only guide on Crypt of the NecroDancer. I've found these to be particularly helpful:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/warachiasouko/%E3%83%9B%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0/necrodancer-english/">Warachia's Warehouse</a> - Comprehensive quick
		kills and other strategies, in the form of YouTube videos.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://psnprofiles.com/guide/7172-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-ultimate-boss-guide">PSNProfiles Boss Guide</a> - Maybe a bit outdated, but these
		strategies have bailed me out of many boss fights.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist/awefawefawefawefawefawef">NecroTome</a> - EladDifficult made YouTube videos on pretty much every enemy and boss in
		the game! I highly recommend watching them if you get stuck.
	</li>
	<li>
		The community - Asking around and sharing with people is the best way to learn the game (other than actually playing it)! They're really friendly, so
		don't be afraid to reach out on the discord or the subreddit.
	</li>
</ul>
