<p class="center">Zone 3 is ice and fire themed. Floor hazards become a bigger deal here.</p>
<br />
<div style="background-image: url('./images/zones/zone 3/zone 3 tiles.png')" class="tile_header"></div>
<br />
<p>This zone is a big jump in difficulty compared to the last one. Lots of enemies move every beat, and need to be dealt with in specific ways.</p>
<h2>Floor hazards</h2>
<p>Two of the main floor hazards in this zone are the ice and hot coal tiles.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		When you move onto an ice tile, you will slide, automatically moving you in the same direction, unless there is something blocking you on the next tile.
		While sliding, you will not be able to make any directional inputs. Trying to press in a direction while sliding will result in a missed beat. However,
		you can still use items.
	</li>
	<li>
		Hot coal tiles are the mostly the opposite: if you <span class="i">stay</span> on a tile for more than one consecutive beat, you will take 1 heart of
		damage. Hopping back and forth between two hot coal tiles will not deal damage. This means that if you have a move-attack weapon, such as a rapier, you
		can attack enemies while dancing between hot coals.
	</li>
</ul>

	This is where having the right kind of boots becomes useful. Before, floor hazards were at most a mild inconvenience. Now, they can hinder your progress
	significantly. Having the right kind of boots can allow you to just ignore them outright.

<h2>Level generation</h2>
<p>
	Zone 3 generates wide open rooms, which makes it easy to get swarmed. It <span class="i">also</span> has the highest activation radius (which means that
	enemies will aggro on you from farther away) just to mess with you. It generates similarly to Zone 2, in a horseshoe fashion; if you can find a secret room
	to dig through, take a chance and peek through it. The exit also usually near the shop, or very far away from the shop. If you see the shop but you can't
	see the shop entrance, you can bomb through the shop to check the other side or just walk around.
</p>
<p>
	You also might have noticed that the song changes, depending on where you are in the level. This is because there are two main sides: the cold side plays
	more techno music, while the hot side plays rock. The cold side tends to spawn more cold enemies while the hot side tends to spawn more hot enemies.
	However, this doesn't really matter too much.
